"""This module serves to run 2. stage (out of 3) of creating simulation -
Shortest Pathfinding.

Finds the shortest path to visit all nodes. First node to visit is the home
node for which A* algorithm is used. Then, we run Dijkstra's algorithm for each
point node to find the shortest distances to all other point nodes.
To find the shortest path between all point nodes we can use either greedy
Naive permutation or Held-Karp algorithm which is alot faster.

Function hierarchy:
find_shortest_path                  - main function
    _validate_and_set_input_pars    - sets parameters
    _find_shortest_distances        - gets shortest distances between points
        _a_star                     - from start to end
        _dijkstra                   - from start to everywhere
            _passable               - checks whether place on map is passable
            get_next_dist           - gets next distance (climb/no climb)
    _held_karp                      - optimal way to find shortest combo path
    _naive_permutations             - greedy way to find shortest combo path
    _get_routes                     - gets coordinate path via parent nodes
    _print_solution                 - prints the routes - solution
    _save_solution                  - saves the solution into pickle file
