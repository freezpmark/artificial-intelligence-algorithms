"""This module serves to run 1. stage (out of 3) of creating simulation -
Map creating with evolutionary algorithm.

The task is to rake the sand on the entire Zen garden. Character always starts
at the edge of the garden and leaves straight shaping path until it meets
another edge or obstacle. On the edge, character can walk as he pleases.
If it comes to an obstacle - wall or raked sand - he has to turn around,
if he is not able to, raking is over.
